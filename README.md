Overview

This project enables quick detection of fire or smoke using two sensors connected to an Arduino UNO R4 Wi‑Fi board. It triggers a buzzer and LEDs locally and sends real-time SMS alerts to a designated number using a cloud SMS API—no GSM hardware needed. It's an affordable and effective safety upgrade for homes or offices .

How It Works

1. Wi‑Fi Connection: Arduino connects to a local Wi‑Fi network using stored credentials.
2. Detection:
 . MQ‑2 sensor measures smoke or combustible gas levels.
 . Flame sensor detects infrared light from fire.
3. Alert Trigger:
 .If smoke or flame exceeds the threshold, Arduino activates a buzzer and red LED, turns off green LED.
 .It sends an HTTP request to the SMS API with your phone number and alert message.
4. SMS Delivery: The cloud SMS API processes and sends the alert to your mobile network — fast, reliable, and free .

Software & SMS Integration

1. Libraries:
 .WiFiS3.h for Wi‑Fi networking
 .Arduino_LED_Matrix.h for onboard LED animations (optional for enhanced UX) 

2. SMS API:
 .Use Circuit Digest Cloud SMS API.
 .Select SMS template (e.g., Device Status Alert ID = 101).
 .Assign template variables (var1, var2) in your code—for instance, var1 = “House”, var2 = “FIRE EMERGENCY!” .



3. HTTP Request:
  Arduino sends alert as JSON via POST (or GET) with API key, recipient number, and message variables.

Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino via the Arduino IDE.


2. Power the system from USB or wall adapter.


3. Green LED indicates normal operation.


4. Smoke or flame triggers red LED, buzzer, and SMS to your phone.


5. Monitor sensor values via Serial or optional LED matrix display.


6. Customize:

Adjust SMOKE_THRESHOLD based on your environment.

Change message content via var1 and var2.

Swap SMS template if preferred.
