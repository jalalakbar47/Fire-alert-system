# 🔥 Fire & Smoke Alarm System with SMS Notification (Wi-Fi | Arduino UNO R4)

A smart DIY system to detect fire and smoke using gas/flame sensors, trigger an alarm, and send instant SMS alerts to your phone using Wi-Fi and a cloud API — **no GSM module required**.

> 📡 Built using **Arduino UNO R4 Wi-Fi**, **MQ-2 gas sensor**, **Flame sensor**, and the **Circuit Digest SMS API**.

## 📌 Overview

This project enables quick fire or smoke detection using two sensors (MQ-2 and flame) connected to an **Arduino UNO R4 Wi-Fi** board.

- 🧯 Triggers a **buzzer** and **LEDs** locally.
- 📤 Sends real-time **SMS alerts** using a **cloud SMS API** — without GSM hardware.
- 🏠 A smart, affordable, and effective safety upgrade for homes and offices.

---

🎯 Features
- Real-time fire/smoke detection
- SMS alerts using cloud API (no GSM module needed)
- Wi-Fi enabled (Arduino UNO R4 Wi-Fi)
- Easy integration and deployment

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Wi-Fi Connection**  
   Arduino connects to a local Wi-Fi network using stored credentials.

2. **Detection**  
   - `MQ-2` detects smoke or gas.
   - `Flame sensor` detects infrared light from fire.

3. **Alert Trigger**  
   - If sensor readings exceed the threshold:
     - 🔴 Red LED turns ON
     - 🟢 Green LED turns OFF
     - 🔊 Buzzer activates
     - 🔗 Arduino sends HTTP request to the SMS API

4. **SMS Delivery**  
   - API sends alert to your phone (e.g. "FIRE EMERGENCY at House")  
   - 📨 Free and fast message delivery via Circuit Digest API

## 🧠 Software & SMS Integration

- Programmed using **Arduino IDE**
- Uses `WiFiS3.h` and `Arduino_LED_Matrix.h` libraries
- Replace the placeholders in code:
  - `ssid`, `password` – your Wi-Fi credentials
  - `phoneNo`, `apiKey` – from Circuit Digest account
  - `templateID`, `var1`, `var2` – customize your SMS template
