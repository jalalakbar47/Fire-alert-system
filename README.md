# Fire Alert System 🔥

An Arduino/Raspberry Pi-based Fire Alert System using Python that detects potential fire hazards via sensors (e.g., smoke or temperature). This project is ideal for home automation, office safety, or industrial applications.

## 🚀 Overview

This system is designed to:
- Monitor environmental conditions using sensors
- Detect possible fire threats in real-time
- Trigger alerts (buzzer, LED, or any external alarm system)
- Provide a modular and simple codebase for easy expansion

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 Monitors fire, smoke, or heat using sensor data
- 🚨 Can trigger real-time alerts (via GPIO)
- 🧱 Simple, modular Python code for beginners
- 🔌 Easily integrable with IoT or home automation systems
- 🧩 Ready for upgrades (email/SMS alerts, cloud dashboard, etc.)

🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. You’ll also need:

GPIO Libraries
Required if using Raspberry Pi (e.g., RPi.GPIO)

Sensor Modules
Example: MQ-2 gas/smoke sensor, DHT11 temperature sensor, etc

🧪 Installation & Usage

Clone the repository and run the code:

git clone https://github.com/jalalakbar47/Fire-alert-system.git
cd Fire-alert-system
pip install -r requirements.txt
python fire_alert_system.py

Make sure your sensors are connected properly to the GPIO pins according to your circuit setup.
