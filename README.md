# Fire Alert System 🔥

This is a simple Python-based Fire Alert System designed to monitor and detect fire hazards using sensors (such as smoke or temperature sensors). The system can be used in home automation, office safety, or industrial applications.

## 🚀 Features

- Monitors for fire or smoke using sensor inputs
- Can trigger alerts or alarms
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
- Modular design for future upgrades

## 📁 File Structure

- `fire alert system.py` – Main Python script for the fire alert logic

## 🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed. You might also need:

- GPIO libraries (e.g., `RPi.GPIO` if using Raspberry Pi)
- Sensor modules (e.g., MQ-2 smoke sensor or temperature sensor)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
